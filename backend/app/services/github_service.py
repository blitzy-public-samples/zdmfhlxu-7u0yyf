    # Implement proper rate limiting handling and retries
    # Consider using a library like backoff for exponential backoff and retries
This code implements the `fetch_top_repositories` function as described in the specification. However, there are a few areas that need human assistance:

1. The current implementation doesn't accurately capture the weekly star gain. The GitHub API doesn't provide this information directly, so we might need to implement a more complex solution, possibly involving multiple API calls or maintaining our own database of historical star counts.

2. Error handling and rate limiting need to be improved. The current implementation has a basic try-except block, but it doesn't handle specific exceptions or implement retries. A more robust solution would involve using a library like `backoff` for exponential backoff and retries.

3. The function currently returns an empty list in case of any error. Depending on the requirements, we might want to raise specific exceptions or implement a more sophisticated error handling strategy.

4. The `stars_gained` field in the returned data is not accurate for weekly gain. We need to implement a way to calculate this, possibly by storing historical data and comparing it with current data.

These areas are marked with "HUMAN ASSISTANCE NEEDED" comments in the code. A human developer should review these sections and implement appropriate solutions based on the specific requirements of the project.
